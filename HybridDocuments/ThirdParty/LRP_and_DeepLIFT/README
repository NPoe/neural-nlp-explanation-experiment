# Description

This code release contains an implementation of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and DeepLIFT for (Q)LSTM, (Q)GRU and CNN as used for the paper [Evaluating Neural Network Explanation Methods using Hybrid Documents and Morphosyntactic Agreement by N. Poerner, B. Roth and H. Schütze, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06422). It is based on the LRP\_for\_LSTM package by Leila Arras released for the paper [Explaining Recurrent Neural Network Predictions in Sentiment Analysis by L. Arras, G. Montavon, K.-R. Müller and W. Samek, 2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W17/W17-5221.pdf).
